Cybersecurity Principles 
(CSP)
 
 
The
 
intent
 
of
 
the
 
Cybersecurity
 
Principles Knowledge
 
Unit
 
is
 
to
 
provide
 
students
 
with
 
basic
 
security
 
design
 
fundamentals
 
that
 
help
 
create
 
systems
 
that
 
are
 
worthy
 
of
 
being
 
trusted.
 
 
Outcomes
 
 
 
 
To complete this KU, students should be able to:
 
1.
 
Define the principles of cybersecurity.
 
2.
 
Describe why each principle is important to 
security and how it enables the development of security 
mechanisms that can implement desired security policies.
 
3.
 
Analyze common security failures and identify specific design principles that have been violated.
 
4.
 
Given a specific scenario, identify the desig
n principles involved or needed.
 
5.
 
Understand the interaction between security and system usability and the importance for 
minimizing the effects of security mechanisms.
